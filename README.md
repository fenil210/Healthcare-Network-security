# Multiclass Classification for Healthcare 4.0 Security

ðŸš€ A project focusing on enhancing the security of remote patient monitoring in Healthcare 4.0 through multiclass classification. It classifies data from various devices, identifying potential threats. Four optimizers (Adam, RMSprop, SGD, AdaGrad) are compared for model efficiency. Implementation is part of the ICCCIS 2023 research paper, soon to be publicly available. ðŸ“ŠðŸ”’

## Key Features
- Multiclass classification for threat identification
- Optimizer comparison: Adam, RMSprop, SGD, AdaGrad
- Implementation associated with ICCCIS 2023 research paper

## Methodology

The multiclass classification approach is employed to categorize data based on its source and determine the presence of any malicious intent. The project utilizes four different optimizers for model training and evaluation:

1. Adam Optimizer
2. RMSprop Optimizer
3. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Optimizer
4. AdaGrad Optimizer

By comparing the performance of these optimizers, the project aims to identify the most suitable optimization algorithm for the given task.

## Getting Started
Check out the code, datasets, and results. Follow instructions in documentation for running and replicating the study.

## Disclaimer
The implementation of this project is part of the research paper presented at ICCCIS 2023. The detailed results and insights will be publicly available on the internet in the coming days.
